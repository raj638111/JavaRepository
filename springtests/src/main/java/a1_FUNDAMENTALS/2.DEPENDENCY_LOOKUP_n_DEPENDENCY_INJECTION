Inversion of Control
----------------------------------------------------------

    #   Is achieved using 2 ways
        +   Dependency Lookup   --10
        +   Dependency Injection
        
    
Dependency Lookup
----------------------------------------------------------10

    #   A component looks for the dependent component
        by using the callback method provided by the Container
        
    #   Good Diagram here...#10
        
        
Dependency Injection
----------------------------------------------------------10

    #   Lookup logic(as done in Dependency Lookup) is removed from Application Code
    
    #   Dependent component is injected into a Component by Container
        using the Components Constructor & Setter method
        
    #   Dependencies are configurable as part of the Container
