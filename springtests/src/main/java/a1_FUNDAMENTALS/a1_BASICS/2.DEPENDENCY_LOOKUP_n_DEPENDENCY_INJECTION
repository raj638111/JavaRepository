Inversion of Control
----------------------------------------------------------

    #   Is achieved using 2 ways
        +   Dependency Lookup   --10
        +   Dependency Injection
    #   Cotainers that implement this paradigm are called as IoC Containers #11
        
    
Dependency Lookup
----------------------------------------------------------10

    #   A component looks for the dependent component(Normally done using JNDI)
        by using the callback method provided by the Container
        
    #   Good Diagram here...#10
        
        
Dependency Injection
----------------------------------------------------------10

    #   Dependent component is injected into a Component by Container
        using the Components Constructor & Setter method

    #   Lookup logic(as done in Dependency Lookup) is removed from Application Code
        
    #   Dependencies are configurable as part of the Container     
    
    #   2 Types
        +   Setter Injection    
        +   Constrcutor Injection   (Not possible to inject at runtime after the Object Creation)
