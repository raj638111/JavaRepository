	Fail fast iterator
		 -> Incase, we have called iterator on a collection object, and another
		 	thread tries to modify the collection object, then concurrent 
		 	modification exception will be thrown
		 -> Detected using 'mods' flag
		 -> According to oracle, there is no hard guarantee for this exception to
		 	be thrown all the time
		 -> http://javahungry.blogspot.com/2014/04/fail-fast-iterator-vs-fail-safe-iterator-difference-with-example-in-java.html
		 -> Ex : HashMap, Vector, ArrayList, HashSet
		 
	Fail Safe Iterator
		->	Do not throw Concurrent Modification Exception as the iterator works on the
			copy of the data structure rather than the original
		->	Ex : ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList
